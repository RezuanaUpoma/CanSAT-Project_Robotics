# CanSAT-Project_Robotics
This project involves a CanSat (a satellite simulation) using an Arduino Nano and various sensors and modules. The system collects environmental data such as temperature, pressure, and distance, and transmits this data using a radio module. The project demonstrates the integration of multiple sensors and data communication.
